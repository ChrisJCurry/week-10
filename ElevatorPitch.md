Hi it's nice to meet you, I'm Chris, I just completed a software development course at Boise CodeWorks. During the course, I worked with a small team to create a fullstack application for 2 weeks, which helped sharpen my fullstack experience as well as working in a team under a set deadline. I enjoyed working on the backend of the application and would like to pursue something similiar!
