Whiteboards: House robber 2. The main goal is to figure out the most amount you can steal in a night without hitting an adjacent house. We think we solved it unfortunately leetcode didn't let us see the answer, but Harrison seemed to agree that we were right.
             Pascal's Triangle. The goal was to write the equation/solve the solution by adding from previous rows above it to equal its value. We feel we solved it, but again, leetcode didn't let us.
Who: Kurtis, Alex, and me.
