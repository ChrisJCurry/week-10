Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?

S - When working as a trainer at McDonald's, we would often have Tourist busses. They would come with very little, if any, notice, while still having to help other customers in the drive-thru or walking in.
    
T - Our goal was to be as efficient as possible. We had to make sure we were constantly stocked and always had food prepared or cooking.

A - Us trainers would step up into a managerial role while the managers were busy helping the customers. We would oversee other workers, help keep the team steady, or help restock if needed.

R - With us stepping up and taking over overseeing the production, we were able to alleviate some stress of our managers and were able to keep a consistent workflow.

Give me an example of a time you were able to be creative with your work. What was exciting or difficult about it?

S - While going to CodeWorks, we had a capstone where our group had creative control over the entire project. 

T - In two weeks, we were tasked with creating a website to showcase for future showcasings in interviews.

A - The biggest difficulty with the website was deciding what to keep or what to drop. While being able to add everything that seems interesting to your project is exciting, it doesn't make a good application. We had to sit down and consider what made our project work, what went well with it, what helped it flow, and what didn't. If it didn't, even if it was exciting to have, we dropped.

R - Doing so made our code cleaner, less clunky, and, without having to use more useless or unhelpful packages, were able to increase performance of the site.

Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?

S - While working at OctaPharma, we went through a transition between two database systems.

T - The company rolled out a new Management System service thats goal was to make our lives easier and kept the company more up to date technology-wise. While the new service was much easier to navigate and use, it still had its issues. The first few weeks, the servers kept crashing due to how many employees were trying to access it, meaning we couldn't help donors or process their plasma. This made work difficult due to having to work around the delays.

A - During the outages/crashes, we would set restrictions on how many donors could come in, otherwise donors would have to sometimes wait hours before donating. This would allow the team to access the service without crashing the service and kept a somewhat slow flow going, while still keeping donor happiness relatively high.

R - While this wasn't ideal, we were able to make our donors lives easier by restricting the amount of people who could come in, who could be signing up, and who could be donating. This made it so the servers were less likely to have issues and were able to keep a consistent flow.
